# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. It allows you to enter tasks for each hour of the standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM) and saves them locally so they persist even after refreshing the page. Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.

## Usage
1. Open the Work Day Scheduler in your web browser.
2. Scroll down to view the time blocks for the day.
3. Each time block represents one hour of the work day (9 AM to 5 PM).
4. Click into a time block to enter an event/task for that hour.
5. Click the "Save" button for that time block to save the event/task.
6. The text for the event/task will be saved in local storage and persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- Displays the current day at the top of the calendar.
- Color-codes time blocks to indicate past, present, or future hours.
- Saves user-entered tasks/events to local storage for persistence.
